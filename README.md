# Ω Omega Studio

Free FiveM scripts. Always.

Omega Studio exists to prove one thing:  
**anyone can code** — and paywalls don’t make scripts better.

## What We Stand For

- 🆓 100% free scripts  
- 🧠 Learning by doing, not by paying  
- ⚙️ Clean, readable, open code  
- 🚫 No escrow, no lock-ins, no nonsense

---

## Philosophy

Good code is built with skill, not a price tag.  
If a script only works because it’s paid, it wasn’t good to begin with.
